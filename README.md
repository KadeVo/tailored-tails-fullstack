# tailored-tails-fullstack

Tailored Tails is an e-commerce website selling pet costumes, built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) and incorporating Redux and Tailwind CSS. JWT-token for authentication and authorization, bcrypt for hashing the user passwords, Stripe for managing payments, and the website is deployed on render.com. 
This repo is the combination of our frontend & backend repositories  which are currently being used to be deployed on render.com. Going forward, I wish to add proper testing and high coverage to the important elements of our website in the near future.
